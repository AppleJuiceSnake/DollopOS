# DollopOS
Apple Juice Snake's Python Operating System.

Be aware that this is in pre-alpha stages, and has very limited functionally


# How To Use DollopOS
Make sure you run "python boot.py" to start DollopOS

If it fails to start, make sure that you have PyGame installed

Various settings can be changed by changing the contents of the .ini files in the settings folder.

To shut down safely, use the shutdown icon that is in the actual pygame window, don't just close the window


# Other Information
If you have any questions, or concerns, feel free to contact us at applejuicesnake@gmail.com

The first letters of Apple Juice are the first letters of the team's first names, and the snake stands for Python.

Python and PyGame are required for this project.
